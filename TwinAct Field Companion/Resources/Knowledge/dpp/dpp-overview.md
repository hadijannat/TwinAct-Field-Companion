# Digital Product Passport (DPP) Overview

## What is a Digital Product Passport?

A Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a digital record containing information about a product's origin, composition, repair and dismantling options, and end-of-life handling. It makes product information accessible throughout the value chain to support circular economy goals.

## Legal Foundation

### ESPR Regulation (2024/1781)
The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation establishes the legal framework for DPPs in the EU. Entered into force July 18, 2024.

**Article 8** specifies DPP requirements:
- Unique product identifier linked to data carrier
- Information accessible via QR code or similar
- Different access levels for different actors
- Data hosted in EU-accessible systems

## Who Must Provide DPPs?

Manufacturers, importers, and authorized representatives placing products on the EU market must ensure DPPs are available. The specific product categories are defined through delegated acts.

**Priority Product Groups:**
1. Textiles and footwear
2. Furniture (including mattresses)
3. Iron and steel products
4. Aluminum products
5. Chemicals and detergents
6. Electronics (ICT equipment)
7. Batteries (already covered by Battery Regulation)
8. Construction products

## Implementation Timeline

- **2024:** ESPR entered into force
- **2026:** First delegated acts expected
- **2027:** Battery Passport mandatory
- **2027-2030:** Phased rollout by product category
- **2030+:** Full coverage

## Technical Implementation

### AAS as Foundation
The European Commission has endorsed the Asset Administration Shell as the technical standard for DPPs. AAS submodels map directly to DPP requirements.

### Data Carrier
Physical products must bear a data carrier (typically QR code) linking to the DPP. Requirements:
- Durable throughout product life
- Easily scannable
- Compliant with ISO/IEC standards

### Data Hosting
DPP data must be accessible via:
- Manufacturer systems
- Authorized data spaces
- EU DPP registry (future)
