# EU Machinery Regulation

## Overview

The Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 replaces the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC with directly applicable EU-wide rules for placing machinery on the market.

**Entry into force:** July 29, 2023
**Applicable from:** January 20, 2027
**Official reference:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1230

## Key Changes from Directive

### Direct Applicability
As a regulation (not directive):
- No national transposition required
- Uniform interpretation across EU
- Immediate effect once applicable

### Digital Instructions
Manufacturers may provide instructions for use:
- Digitally (default option)
- Paper format available on request
- Digital must be accessible throughout product lifetime

### AI Safety Requirements
Specific provisions for machinery incorporating AI:
- Safety during machine learning phases
- Robustness against adversarial manipulation
- Human oversight requirements
- Integration with EU AI Act

### Cybersecurity
New essential health and safety requirements for:
- Protection against corruption
- Secure software updates
- Resilience against cyber attacks

### Substantial Modification
Clearer definition of when modifications trigger re-certification:
- New hazards introduced
- Risk level increased
- No longer conforming to original assessment

## Scope

### Covered Products

**Machinery:**
- Assembly of linked parts with at least one moving part
- Driven by energy application other than human/animal force
- Intended for specific application

**Related Products:**
- Interchangeable equipment
- Safety components
- Lifting accessories
- Chains, ropes, and webbing
- Removable mechanical transmission devices
- Partly completed machinery

### Exclusions
- Weapons and ammunition
- Nuclear equipment
- Electrical equipment for household use
- Agricultural tractors (covered by specific regulation)
- Motor vehicles (covered by type-approval)
- Ships and marine equipment
- Lifts in mines

## Essential Health and Safety Requirements

### General Requirements (Annex III, Section 1)

**Risk Assessment Principles:**
- Determine machinery limits
- Identify hazards and associated risks
- Estimate risks
- Evaluate risks
- Eliminate or reduce through design
- Implement safeguarding measures
- Inform users of residual risks

**Materials and Products:**
- No hazards from materials
- Fluid compatibility
- Prevention of sharp edges

**Lighting:**
- Integrated lighting for operations
- No shadows or glare
- Adequate for maintenance areas

**Design for Handling:**
- Safe handling provisions
- Lifting points marked
- Stability considerations

### Controls and Control Systems (Section 1.2)

**Safety and Reliability:**
- Control systems must be safe and reliable
- No dangerous situations from logic faults
- Reasonably foreseeable misuse considered

**Control Devices:**
- Clearly visible and identifiable
- Safe to operate
- Positioned to avoid hazards
- Designed for foreseeable use

**Start-up:**
- Only by voluntary actuation
- Re-start prevention after stops
- Multiple control positions considered

**Stopping:**
- Normal stop function required
- Emergency stop where necessary
- Stop category appropriate to hazard

### AI and Machine Learning (Section 1.2.1)
New requirements for AI-enabled machinery:

**Safety Functions:**
- Must not compromise safety during learning
- Predictable behavior under all conditions
- Fail-safe operation if AI fails

**Human Oversight:**
- Human must remain in control
- AI decisions can be overridden
- Clear indication of AI operating state

**Robustness:**
- Resistant to adversarial inputs
- Graceful degradation on failure
- Logging of AI decisions affecting safety

### Cybersecurity (Section 1.1.9)
Protection requirements:
- Against corruption (hardware and software)
- Evidence of legitimate intervention
- Secure software update mechanisms
- Authentication for safety-critical access

## Conformity Assessment

### Self-Assessment (Module A)
Applicable to most machinery:
- Complete technical documentation
- Ensure conformity with requirements
- Draw up EU Declaration of Conformity
- Affix CE marking

### Third-Party Assessment
Required for high-risk machinery (Annex I):
- Module B (EU type-examination) + Module C/D
- Module H (full quality assurance)

### High-Risk Machinery Categories (Annex I)
1. Circular saws and sawing machines
2. Hand-fed surface planing machines
3. Thicknessers and combined machines
4. Band-saws
5. Combined machines for woodworking
6. Tenoning machines
7. Chain saws
8. Presses (metal working)
9. Injection or compression plastics-moulding machines
10. Underground machinery (locomotives, powered supports)
11. Manually loaded trucks for waste collection
12. Removable mechanical transmission devices
13. Lifting equipment for persons
14. Power take-offs
15. Construction site hoists
16. Vehicle servicing lifts
17. Machines for underground working

## Documentation Requirements

### Technical Documentation
Must demonstrate conformity and include:
- General description
- Design drawings
- Calculation methods
- Test results
- Risk assessment documentation
- Harmonized standards applied
- Instructions for use

### Instructions for Use
Required content:
- Business name and postal address
- Designation and serial number
- EU Declaration of Conformity
- General description
- Installation and commissioning
- Operation instructions
- Maintenance requirements
- Foreseeable misuse warnings

### EU Declaration of Conformity
Manufacturer's declaration confirming:
- Product identification
- Applicable legislation
- Standards applied
- Manufacturer/authorized representative identity
- Responsible person signature

## CE Marking

- Affixed visibly, legibly, indelibly
- Minimum 5mm height
- On machinery itself (not just packaging)
- Accompanied by identification of manufacturer
- Year of affixing indicated if relevant
