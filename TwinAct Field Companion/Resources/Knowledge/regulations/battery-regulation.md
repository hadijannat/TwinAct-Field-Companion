# EU Battery Regulation

## Overview

The Battery Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 establishes comprehensive rules for batteries placed on the EU market, including sustainability, labeling, and end-of-life requirements. It introduces the Battery Passport as a precursor to broader DPP implementation.

**Entry into force:** August 17, 2023
**Official reference:** Regulation (EU) 2023/1542

## Scope and Battery Categories

### Portable Batteries
- Weight ≤ 5 kg
- Sealed, non-industrial
- Not designed for industrial use
- Examples: AA/AAA, phone batteries, power banks

### Light Means of Transport (LMT) Batteries
- Provide electric power to light vehicles
- ≤ 25 kg weight
- Examples: e-bike batteries, e-scooter batteries

### Starting, Lighting, Ignition (SLI) Batteries
- Start engines
- Power vehicle lights
- Run ignition systems
- Typically 12V lead-acid or lithium

### Industrial Batteries
- > 5 kWh capacity
- Designed for industrial/professional use
- Examples: forklift batteries, grid storage

### Electric Vehicle (EV) Batteries
- Traction batteries in electric vehicles
- High capacity, typically > 20 kWh
- Includes plug-in hybrids and BEVs

## Battery Passport (Article 77)

- Voltage
- Expected lifetime (cycles)
- State of health tracking

**Carbon Footprint:**
- Total CO2 equivalent
- Calculation methodology
- Life cycle phase breakdown
- Third-party verification status

**Material Composition:**
- Cobalt content and origin
- Lithium content and origin
- Lead content
- Nickel content
- Critical raw material declarations

**Supply Chain:**
- Due diligence summary

**End-of-Life:**
- Removal instructions
- Recycling information
- Hazardous material warnings
- Recycler contact information

### Access Requirements
- QR code providing access to passport
- Machine-readable format
- Updated throughout battery life
- Multiple access levels (consumer, professional, authority)

## Carbon Footprint Requirements

### Phase 1: Declaration (February 2025)
All EV and industrial batteries must declare carbon footprint.

### Phase 2: Performance Classes (August 2026)
Introduction of carbon footprint performance classes (A-G or similar scale).

### Phase 3: Maximum Thresholds (2028)
Maximum carbon footprint limits established; non-compliant batteries cannot be placed on market.

### Calculation Methodology
Based on Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR):
- Cradle-to-gate scope
- GHG Protocol aligned
- ISO 14067 compliant
- Verified by third party (for declarations)

## Recycled Content Targets

### 2031 Targets
- Cobalt: 16% from recycled sources
- Lithium: 6% from recycled sources
- Nickel: 6% from recycled sources
- Lead: 85% from recycled sources

### 2036 Targets
- Cobalt: 26% from recycled sources
- Lithium: 12% from recycled sources
- Nickel: 15% from recycled sources
- Lead: 85% from recycled sources

## State of Health (SoH) Requirements

### Battery Management System (BMS) Requirements
All LMT, industrial, and EV batteries must have BMS providing:
- Original capacity baseline
- Current capacity
- Capacity fade measurement
- Cycle count tracking
- Temperature history (extreme events)
- Charging event count
- Expected remaining useful life

### SoH Data Access
- Real-time access for vehicle/device owner
- Diagnostic access for repairers
- Historical data for second-life assessment
- Battery passport updates

## Labeling Requirements

### General Labeling (All Batteries)
- Crossed-out wheeled bin symbol
- Chemical symbols (Cd, Pb, Hg if present)
- Capacity in Ah or Wh
- CE marking

### Portable Battery Labeling
- Minimum usage duration icon (hours)
- Separate collection information

### Industrial/EV Battery Labeling
- QR code for battery passport
- Unique identifier
- Carbon footprint class (when applicable)
- Safety/handling instructions

## Collection and Recycling Targets

### Collection Rates
- Portable: 45% (2023), 63% (2027), 73% (2030)
- LMT/Industrial/EV: 100% to treatment facilities

### Recycling Efficiency
- Lead-acid: 75%
- Lithium-based: 65% (2025), 70% (2030)
- Other: 50%

### Material Recovery
- Cobalt: 90% (2027), 95% (2031)
- Copper: 90% (2027), 95% (2031)
- Lead: 90% (2027), 95% (2031)
- Lithium: 50% (2027), 80% (2031)
- Nickel: 90% (2027), 95% (2031)

## Due Diligence Requirements

Operators must implement supply chain due diligence covering:
- Cobalt and natural graphite sourcing
- Human rights assessment
- Environmental impact assessment
- Third-party audit requirements
- Remediation procedures

Based on OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.
