## Relationship to Other Legislation

### Battery Regulation
Already includes specific DPP requirements for batteries. ESPR complements but doesn't duplicate battery provisions.

### Machinery Regulation
ESPR applies to machinery except where specific exemptions exist. Environmental requirements complement safety requirements.

### WEEE Directive
ESPR recyclability requirements support WEEE objectives. Data sharing for end-of-life management.

### REACH Regulation
ESPR builds on REACH substance restrictions. DPP includes SVHC disclosure requirements.
